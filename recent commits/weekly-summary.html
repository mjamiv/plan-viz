    <h2>Monday, January 19</h2>

    <h3>CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance</h3>
    <p>The day began with a quick fix to the GitHub Actions deployment pipeline. The cache configuration in the frontend deployment workflow was causing issues, so unnecessary cache settings were removed to streamline the build process. This was a targeted fix that resolved deployment friction.</p>

    <div class="value-add">
        <strong>Value Add:</strong> Ensures reliable automated deployments to GitHub Pages, reducing manual intervention and deployment failures.
    </div>

    <h3>Major OCR Pipeline Expansion</h3>
    <p>The primary focus of the day was a significant expansion of the OCR processing capabilities. This was a substantial update touching multiple files with new functionality added across the backend and frontend.</p>

    <p>Key improvements included enhanced export functionality in the results router with new CSV and JSON export endpoints, expanded OCR service capabilities with support for multiple OCR providers (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, Surya), and improved error handling across all processing routers. The frontend received new viewer components and styling updates to display OCR results with overlay capabilities.</p>

    <div class="value-add">
        <strong>Value Add:</strong> Dramatically improves the document processing pipeline with multi-provider OCR support and comprehensive export options, making the tool production-ready for construction PDF analysis workflows.
    </div>

    <h2>Wednesday, January 21</h2>

    <h3>Documentation & Feature Completion</h3>
    <p>Wednesday was a highly productive day focused on documentation and feature completion. The development checklist was updated to reflect the current implementation status, providing clear visibility into project progress and remaining work.</p>

    <p>A major push was made to implement remaining features needed for testing, bringing the application closer to a fully testable state. The README was also enhanced with mermaid diagrams, making the project architecture and data flows easier to understand for new contributors.</p>

    <p>The day concluded with the merge of Pull Request #1, integrating the search and summarize todos feature from the claude branch. This represents the first external contribution merged into the main branch.</p>

    <div class="value-add">
        <strong>Value Add:</strong> Comprehensive documentation and feature completion moves the project toward production readiness, while the merged PR establishes a healthy collaboration workflow.
    </div>

    <h2>Thursday, January 22</h2>

    <h3>AI Provider Expansion</h3>
    <p>Thursday focused on expanding the application's AI capabilities. A new OpenAI VLM (Vision Language Model) provider was added, giving users an alternative to the existing Ollama integration. The UI was also simplified to improve the user experience when selecting and configuring VLM providers.</p>

    <h3>Windows Compatibility Fix</h3>
    <p>A critical bug fix was implemented for the Poppler path on Windows systems. This ensures PDF processing works correctly across different operating systems, improving cross-platform compatibility for the entire user base.</p>

    <div class="value-add">
        <strong>Value Add:</strong> Multiple VLM provider options give users flexibility in choosing their preferred AI backend, while Windows compatibility fixes expand the potential user base.
